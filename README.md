# PowerBall with Ruby

This simple project allows the user to see the frequency of lottery and Power Ball numbers over a 20-year span.  The data used is the readily open data set located at "http://www.powerball.com/powerball/winnums-text.txt".

Disclosure: This project is meant for entertainment value and is not meant to predict the probability of money raining on you.  

Please, let me know if there any improvements I can make.
